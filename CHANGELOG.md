  - `package:sql_records/postgres.dart`
- Generalized `SqliteRecords` to `SqlRecords` to support multiple database engines.
- `SqliteRecords` and `SqliteRecordsReadonly` are now type aliases for backward compatibility.
- Introduced `MutationResult` to provide a unified result for `execute` across engines.

## 0.2.0
